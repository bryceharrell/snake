I hardcoded the size of the board in some of the earlier tasks which led me into bugs down the road. 

The hardest part was definitely task 7 because any mistakes that were not caught in the earlier tasks showed up and were hard to discover the source of. I also struggled a lot with task 1 at first because I felt that I had little knowledge of how malloc/arrays/pointers all worked together with each other. I think it would be beneficial to give more hints on part 1 in the future.

Overall, it was a good and challenging project.
